You’ve arrived at Queen’s Park where you encounter a lush expanse of greenery, dotted with towering trees and vibrant flower beds. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blossoms, and the sound of birdsong filled the air, lending the park an ethereal quality. Here you see Professor Sadia walking her dog. She says she found your t-card that you accidentally left afterclass, and kindly gave it to you (you can pick up). Out of gratitude, you decide to get her dog some treats.

You have arrived at your friend's dorm, in Innis College. You're greeted warmly as they offer a tour. They mention the campus's summer charm, with cats and dogs roaming about. Noting the cats' affinity for salmon, they stored cans of salmon in their dorm. They are offering you a can for you to feed the cats along the way. Additionally, they also have dog treats handy for any canine companions you might encounter. (Your backpack can at most fit one proportion of the cat or dog food.)
